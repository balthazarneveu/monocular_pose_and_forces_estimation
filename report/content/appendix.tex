\subsection{Camera calibration}
\label{sec:cam_calib}
using a 7x10 printed checkerboard 
and the OpenCV implementation of the Zhang's method~\cite{Zhang00calib}.
Below, we detail the focal length estimation from camera specifications.
Xiaomi Mi11 Ultra main camera ($2.8\mu m$ pixel pitch) specifications in photo mode:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 24mm focal length - full frame (24x36mm) equivalent
    \item Sensor size 4000x3000 = 12Mpix
\end{itemize}
We end up with a focal length for the photo mode of $f_{\text{pix}}^{\text{photo}}  = 24mm * 4000px / 36mm = 2666px$.

But since we're using a FullHD video mode with a crop factor of around 15\% on each side,
it is needed to rescale the focal length acordingly $f_{\text{pix}}^{\text{video}} = 2666px * 1.3 * \frac{1920px}{4000px} \approx 1664px$.
Calibration method provides a estimated focal length of $1690px$ which is close enough to the specifications.
We assume the camera to be a pinhole and neglect radial distortion.
