\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, our review and reimplementation of~\citet{li2019estimating}'s paper provided valuable insights into the complexity 
and challenges of estimating 3D motion and forces in human-object interactions from RGB videos. 
The original work stands as a significant novel contribution to this field. While our reimplementation is restricted to a simpler use case,
we still faced a few difficulties, particularly in applying the method to real-world data.
It still allowed us to highlight some limitations of the original method and to propose some tracks for improvements.
