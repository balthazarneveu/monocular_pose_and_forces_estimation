\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, our review and reimplementation of~\citet{li2019estimating}'s paper provided valuable insights into the complexities 
and challenges of estimating 3D motion and forces in human-object interactions from RGB videos. 
The original work stands as a significant novel contribution to this field. While our reimplementation is simplified and restricted, 
and faced difficulties, particularly in applying the method to real-world data, it still highlighted some limitations of the original method.
